# CODE_A_BIT_LIT_PEC2020

This repository contains the files for our theme of data visualisation for the software hackathon Code_a_bit_lit
which was held on 8th June 2020.

The file named Code_A_Bit_Lit_Team #8 is the final commit file which is our final notebook for our multiple visualisations
of the dataset.

It also contains a video and a temp notebook which were committed at 12 midnight, showing our progress 
since the hackathon had started.
